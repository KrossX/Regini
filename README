Regini - Basic I/O for Registry and/or Settings files
===============================================================================

It's reg files io, that can produce Windows Registry compatible files, which
are also usable as simple setting files.

Made mostly to unify the fileio for my projects and to support RegEmu. That
way I'll have registry IO and settings on the same thing.

To use it, just get the regini.h/.cpp files. The current project will build
a console program that can be used for testing.
